                <h2>What is online trading?</h2>          
                <p>What is online tradingOnline trading involves buying and selling stocks, commodities, currency pairs, cryptocurrencies or other instruments through a trading platform</p>
                <p> or mobile app. The goal is to achieve returns that outperform buy-and-hold investments. Trading is a form of speculative investment. While investors may be satisfied with annual</p>               
                   <p> returns that beat inflation, traders may seek a greater return each month. Trading profits are achieved by buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price over a relatively</p>
                   <p> short period of time. The opposite is also true: trading profits can be made by selling at a higher price and buying to cover at a lower price (known as “selling short”) to make a </p>
                   <p>profit in bear markets. However, please note that short selling is a high-risk online trading method because the prices of any assets can continue to rise - in theory this rise</p>
                   <p> may be beyond your limits. What's also important to know about the reality of electronic trading is that you will most often be using derivative products to speculate on price</p>                   
                   <p>movements of the underlying asset - without owning the asset itself. This is because financial derivatives such as CFDs track the price of the asset on which they are based.</p>                   
                    <p>Traders who use derivatives trading never have the right to take delivery of the underlying assets, so whether you are trading a physical commodity such as gold, oil, forex,</p>
                    <p> bitcoin or stocks. In comparison, if you invest, you will buy, hold and sell assets.A “ contract for difference”, or “CFD” , is an agreement to exchange the difference in the price </p>                    
                    <p>of the underlying asset, measured from the time the contract is opened until the time it is closed.For example, you are conducting an analysis and believe that Tesla's stock</p>            
                    <p>price will rise from its current level of $900. So, you trade long (open long position) with five CFDs on Tesla shares . Your forecast is correct, and you close your position when</p>
                    <p>> the market reaches a selling price of $975. The difference is $75.</p>
